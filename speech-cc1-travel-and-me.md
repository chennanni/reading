Travel and Me

1 GREEDY

My name is Max. And the reason of picking this name myself is very simple. I want the max of everything. The good, the bad, the happiness, the disappointment. I want it all. A friend said I’m greedy. And I think he’s right. Even in the dream, I want to dream the biggest, the max.

I dreamed about travelling around the world. To see the corpse flower in Amazon, if they really eat humans. To step on the glacier in the South Pole, if they really moves. To ride horse, sheep and cows, and drink Kumiss in Mongolia, and dance by the campfire until dawn.

As I grew older, innocence was walking away from me, greedy wasn’t, but I also got some in return, which was better judgement. I started to draw dots and lines, as a ladder to reach my dream in the end. I did go to Mongolia, and drink Kumiss. I didn’t go to South Pole yet, but I did learn snowboarding and get pretty good at it. I didn’t go to Amazon yet, but I did have several camping trip and getting familiar with the wild.

I’m still greedy, but overtime I learned to use that greedy towards something meaningful in life, to help me to hit the goals and milestones. That’s my reconciliation with my greedy.

2 TRAVELLING

Greedy is one of my personalities. Talking about my habits, I like travelling, I love travelling. Oscar Wilde once said: we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. XiaoSong said something similar: beyond the pots and pans, there should be poetry and the far afield. I think they are both right. But with all the other profound meaning in it, for me travelling is simply having fun. 

One of my recent memorable travels is last year late summer. We planned to go to OC, NJ to ride motorcycle, playing in the beach, and see firework at night. 

At that day, I went there, there’s couple of other guys, friends of friends. We didn’t know everyone, but after a few minutes, we realized we had a common friend. By talking jokes about him, suddenly we got closer and the ice between us broke. Not for long, we started to tease each other. I remember there’s one guy wearing Google Glass. And we all made fun of him of taking such fragile equipment to a such violent water sport. And he must be getting very good pay from his company.

Then we went playing water motorcycle. Two people at max for one machine. One driver, one passenger. The operation is very simple. It’s just like driving a motorcycle on the land, except you don’t have a brake. So how do you stop? Actually the friction on water is very high. Without fuel, your speed turns down very fast and in seconds, you are just floating on waves.

One hour drive is super exciting and fun, full of shout and cry. After that, we headed to the beach. Walking by the streets, we saw this amazing dragon statue, just like the one in Game of Thrones. Also there are shops selling all kinds of interesting snacks. I tried one Korean food that mixes meat into the milk tea. Its taste was kind of wield, but I still admire the cook’s imagination and courage to make up such a cuisine.

Then we arrived the beach, and there’s only one legitimate thing you should do on the beach, which is just lying down.

To sum up, this is a great experience. With some old friends, new friends, get to eat delicious food and made some previous memories.

3 ENDING

I’m greedy. I love travelling. Greedy is a monster, and travelling is the treasure. Combining these two together, this is like the tiger sniffing the rose in me. 

There are other aspects about me. For example, I like my house to be clean all the time. I like drinking coke and eating fried chicken after workout. I like doing yoga and working on the handstand pose. All these aspects defines me and makes me one of the only in the world. 

For another day, I can be Mr Humble or Mr Techies or Mr Heart-broke, today I’m simply Max, doing CC1 here, love travelling and being max greedy.
